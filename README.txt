This project is a personal initiative aimed at developing a platform facilitating the process of 
publishing (hosting) and renting (guests) apartments without incurring additional fees for the 
property owner or the guest. Transactions are handled through a designated contract called Escrow, securely holding 
the funds throughout the reservation period.

In the event of any disputes, the resolution is determined by the decentralized judicial court system
provided by Kleros Court (kleros.io). This ensures a fair and impartial decision-making process, enhancing the
overall reliability of the platform.
